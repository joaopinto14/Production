# ‚öôÔ∏è *Production*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository contains the source code for the *Docker* image "***Production***". This *Docker* image 
was specifically designed to be compact and efficient, with the sole purpose of enabling the execution of your web project
in a production environment.

## üìñ **Project Description**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *Docker* image "***Production***", based on the Linux distribution *Alpine* 3.19, was designed to be efficient and easy
to use. It comes equipped with *PHP* 8.3 and the extensions *core, date, filter, hash, json, libxml, pcre, random, readline,
reflection, spl, standard, and zlib*. For the web server, *NGINX* 1.24.0-r15 is used, thus allowing the efficient execution
of web projects. If additional adjustments are necessary, they can be made simply and easily, using the available 
[environment variables](#-environment-variables).

## ‚öíÔ∏è **Image Build**

Follow the steps below to build the *Docker* image:

1. Clone the repository with the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/joaopinto14/Production.git
```

1. Navigate to the project directory with the command:

```
cd Production
```

1. Build the *Docker* image with the command:

```
docker build -t production .
```

## üìë Environment Variables

- **PHP_EXTENSIONS**: The *PHP* extensions to be installed. Default: null (e.g.: pdo_mysql mysqli)
- **PROJECT_PATH**: The path to the project directory. Default: /var/www/html
- **MEMORY_LIMIT**: The memory limit that *PHP* can use. Default: 128M
- **UPLOAD_MAX**: The maximum size of files that can be uploaded. Default: 8M

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Usage Examples**

### - Using the command line:
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /path/to/your/project:/var/www/html -e PHP_EXTENSIONS="pdo_mysql mysqli" -e MEMORY_LIMIT=256M -e UPLOAD_MAX=16M -e PROJECT_PATH=/var/www/html/public production
```
### - Using *Docker Compose*:
```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: production
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/your/project:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - PHP_EXTENSIONS=pdo_mysql mysqli
      - MEMORY_LIMIT=256M
      - UPLOAD_MAX=16M
      - PROJECT_PATH=/var/www/html/public

## ü™ß **Extra**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need a *Docker* image for tasks such as environment setup, dependency installation, code 
compilation, or test execution, it is recommended to use a dedicated development image, use the image 
"[Development](https://github.com/joaopinto14/Development)". This was specifically designed to facilitate and optimize these tasks.
